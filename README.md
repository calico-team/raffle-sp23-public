# raffle-sp23

This is the code that runs the raffle for CALICO Spring '23!

Install stuff with:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run `python3 raffle.py` and see the magic happen before your very eyes!

Or you can just look at `results.txt`.

Also check out the glorious `seed.txt`.

Congrats to everyone who won!

TODO explain how the scripts work and stop procrastinating writing documentation

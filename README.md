TODO copy over relevant announcements that explain how the code works
TODO add/fix documentation because some of this stuff below is outdated

- When converting the leaderboard with https://www.convertcsv.com/html-table-to-csv.htm, the first team's column has the contest name in it. Remove it!
- Make sure the column indices match up (visually confirm-- index 0 may not be the first column)
- Make sure you adjust the column numbers of everything each time
- Manually adjust the formula for calculating tickets if you want
- Currently uses score to calculate tickets, rather than which problems were solved

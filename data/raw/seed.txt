u guys are way too predictable. here's a bit of help from chatgpt


[04/04/2023 8:04 PM] alfphaderp#4023

Alright, here's a weird and unpredictable text you can use to seed your random number generator:

Have you ever found yourself lost in the middle of the desert, surrounded by cacti and tumbleweeds, with nothing but a can of pickles and a kazoo to keep you company? No? Well, let me tell you, it's not as bad as it sounds.

For one, pickles are surprisingly versatile. You can use them to quench your thirst, spice up a dull meal, or even as makeshift projectiles to fend off rattlesnakes. And as for the kazoo... well, let's just say that you haven't lived until you've played "Flight of the Bumblebee" on a kazoo while staring out at a sea of sand.

But let's not forget about the other inhabitants of the desert. There are scorpions, of course, but they're not all bad. Some of them are quite friendly, once you get to know them. And the vultures... well, let's just say that they're excellent conversationalists. They may not say much, but they're great listeners.

And let's not forget about the sandstorms. Sure, they can be a bit unsettling at first, but once you get used to the feeling of sand in your hair and your eyes, they're actually quite invigorating. It's like a free exfoliation session!

So the next time you find yourself lost in the desert with nothing but a can of pickles and a kazoo, don't despair. Embrace the weirdness and unpredictability of the situation, and who knows - you might just have the time of your life. And if all else fails, you can always start a band with the vultures.
```

Among Us is a multiplayer game for four to fifteen players.[12] Up to three players are randomly[13] and secretly chosen to be the Impostor(s) each round. As of 2021, four playable maps are available, a spaceship called "The Skeld", an office building called "MIRA HQ", a planet base called "Polus",[14] or "The Airship", a setting from Innersloth's Henry Stickmin series.[15][16] The Crewmates can win the game one of two ways; either by completing all assigned tasks or by ejecting all Impostors. Impostors can likewise win in two ways; either by killing or ejecting all Crewmates,[e] or by sabotaging a critical system on the map (provided the Crewmates do not resolve it in time).[f][14][17][18][19] At the start of the game, Crewmates are assigned "tasks" to complete around the map in the form of minigames, minipuzzles, and simple toggles, mostly consisting of maintenance work on vital systems such as fixing wires and downloading data.[20] Impostors cannot complete tasks, but may pretend to perform "fake" tasks to feign appearance as legitimate Crewmates. Impostors, however, can perform sabotages, ranging from minor (such as disabling lights, making Crewmates blind) to critical (such as disabling oxygen generators), requiring immediate counteraction by Crewmates to prevent their deaths. Impostors may enter and traverse ventilation ducts (commonly known as "venting"), and kill nearby Crewmates. To help Crewmates identify Impostors, there are various surveillance systems on each map, such as security cameras on The Skeld,[21] a doorlog system with sensors in MIRA HQ,[22] and a vitals indicator in Polus that shows the living status of all players.[14] In addition, certain "visual tasks" provide animated cues, such as scanning oneself in the Skeld's medbay. As Impostors cannot perform tasks, Crewmates can use visual tasks to confirm their identity to nearby Crewmates.[23]

GitHub is like a virtual playground for developers, except instead of monkey bars and seesaws, there are pull requests and merge conflicts. And instead of getting scraped knees, you get merge conflicts that make you want to scrape your entire codebase. But hey, at least you can always find solace in the fact that you're not alone in your struggles, as there are thousands of other developers out there dealing with the same issues. Just remember to always commit early and commit often, unless you want to spend your entire weekend trying to figure out where you went wrong. Happy coding!

I’m telling you, Cole is as cracked as he is jacked. Saw him the other day benching 696lbs while wearing plot armor for life. I asked him what he was doing and he said "better than you" and walked out with a explosion. Later on I saw him in a cafeteria working with benq to propose some innovative problems. When I commented on how high quality they were, Cole just nodded slightly and went back to inventing quantum computing. When I was first in line to buy state of the art Cole quantum computers, Cole gave me a small discount, but as I expressed my gratitude, he walked away and adjusted his plot armor.

Welcome to Wikipedia,
the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit.

From today's featured article
John C. Young (1803–1857) was an American educator and pastor who was the fourth president of Centre College in Danville, Kentucky. He entered the ministry in Lexington, Kentucky, in 1828. He accepted the presidency of Centre College in 1830, holding the position until his death in 1857, making him the longest-serving president in the college's history. During his term, he increased the endowment of the college more than fivefold and increased the graduating class size from two students in his first year to forty-seven in his final year. Continuing to preach while in office, Young accepted the pastorate of the Danville Presbyterian Church in 1834, and founded the Second Presbyterian Church in Danville in 1852. He was elected moderator of the Presbyterian Church's General Assembly in 1853. Young is the namesake of several facets of the college today, including Young Hall. He was the father of William C. Young, who later became Centre's eighth president. 

Did you know ...
... that porcelain lithophanes (examples pictured) are intended to be viewed when lit from behind?
... that when Nestor Binabo's wife was freed by her kidnappers, she was given a bag of fish and told to make her husband peppersoup?
... that the Poison Book Project has identified more than 100 books that contain arsenic?
... that for Live at Bush Hall the band Black Country, New Road created three distinct backstories for its performances, including one about a pizza chef who comes across a poltergeist?
... that the children of papercutting artist Claire von Greyerz received some of their education together with Napoleon III?
... that originally, residents of New York City's Ansonia Hotel received fresh eggs from a farm on its roof?
... that a Lady Gaga song became popular 11 years after its release, when videos showing Jenna Ortega, as Wednesday Addams, dancing to the song became viral on TikTok?

hello


[04/05/2023 5:09 AM] bleu#5814
I love bread. I love the plush feeling of dough as it’s kneaded around and around, the buttery aroma that envelops me moments before I take a bite, the sensation of gluten strands shredding across the front of my teeth, the feeling of bliss decomposing within me as enzymes pounce and tear at the mush that remains, the adrenaline rush as I reach for another loaf I did not pay for, the sense of anticipation that heightens as I lean in for my next bite—I love bread.

Section II has made clear the relations of the Communists to the existing working-class parties, such as the Chartists in England and the Agrarian Reformers in America.

The Communists fight for the attainment of the immediate aims, for the enforcement of the momentary interests of the working class; but in the movement of the present, they also represent and take care of the future of that movement. In France, the Communists ally with the Social-Democrats against the conservative and radical bourgeoisie, reserving, however, the right to take up a critical position in regard to phases and illusions traditionally handed down from the great Revolution.

In Switzerland, they support the Radicals, without losing sight of the fact that this party consists of antagonistic elements, partly of Democratic Socialists, in the French sense, partly of radical bourgeois.

In Poland, they support the party that insists on an agrarian revolution as the prime condition for national emancipation, that party which fomented the insurrection of Cracow in 1846.

In Germany, they fight with the bourgeoisie whenever it acts in a revolutionary way, against the absolute monarchy, the feudal squirearchy, and the petty bourgeoisie.

...

In short, the Communists everywhere support every revolutionary movement against the existing social and political order of things.

In all these movements, they bring to the front, as the leading question in each, the property question, no matter what its degree of development at the time.

Finally, they labour everywhere for the union and agreement of the democratic parties of all countries.

The Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims. They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions. Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win.

I’m telling you, Cole is as cracked as he is jacked. Saw him the other day benching 696lbs while wearing plot armor for life. I asked him what he was doing and he said "better than you" and walked out with a explosion. Later on I saw him in a cafeteria working with benq to propose some innovative problems. When I commented on how high quality they were, Cole just nodded slightly and went back to inventing quantum computing. When I was first in line to buy state of the art Cole quantum computers, Cole gave me a small discount, but as I expressed my gratitude, he walked away and adjusted his plot armor.

Bread is undoubtedly one of the most divine and versatile food items on this planet. From the moment one sets eyes on freshly baked bread, the enticing aroma and visual appeal ignites the senses, leaving the mouth watering in anticipation. The texture of bread varies based on the type of bread, but it is consistently satisfying and comforting, making it a favorite worldwide.
As you take a bite, the crust crackles satisfyingly, releasing a burst of flavors that dance on your tongue. The dense, yet pillowy soft interior of bread provides a comforting chewiness, and the sensation of the warmth from the bread melting in your mouth is simply heavenly. Each bite provides a different experience, with the flavors and textures blending together in a perfect harmony. The buttery aroma mixed with the grainy and earthy texture of whole wheat bread makes it a perfect choice for breakfast, while the tangy and chewy sourdough bread is perfect for making sandwiches or dipping in soup.
Bread is a food that can evoke memories, emotions and experiences. Its versatility is endless - from sweet to savory, from plain to filled, it is a staple in many cultures and cuisines around the world. Even the sound of the crust crunching or the bread being sliced brings a sense of satisfaction and contentment.

Oh, how I adore bread! The very thought of sinking my teeth into a warm, freshly baked loaf sends shivers down my spine. The soft and tender texture, coupled with the buttery aroma that wafts from the oven, is simply irresistible. Whether it's a crusty baguette, a fluffy brioche, or a hearty sourdough, I cannot resist its allure. I love the way the gluten strands stretch and pull as I tear into a loaf, the way the crumbs scatter and fall, and the sound of the crust crackling under my fingers. Bread is more than just sustenance; it's a sensory experience that ignites my taste buds and fills me with an indescribable joy. I could eat bread every day and never tire of its deliciousness. It is, without a doubt, my favorite food in the world, and I am grateful for its existence.

Hey guys, did you know that in terms of human companionship, Flareon is objectively the most huggable Pokemon? While their maximum temperature is likely too much for most, they are capable of controlling it, so they can set themselves to the perfect temperature for you. Along with that, they have a lot of fluff, making them undeniably incredibly soft to touch. But that's not all, they have a very respectable special defense stat of 110, which means that they are likely very calm and resistant to emotional damage. Because of this, if you have a bad day, you can vent to it while hugging it, and it won't mind. It can make itself even more endearing with moves like Charm and Baby Doll Eyes, ensuring that you never have a prolonged bout of depression ever again.

I love soup. I love the pleasurable feeling of soup as it’s swirled around and around, the soupy aroma that envelops me moments before I take a drink, the sensation of liquid strands melting across the front of my teeth, the feeling of bliss decomposing within me as enzymes pounce and tear at the mush that remains, the adrenaline rush as I reach for another bowl I did not pay for, the sense of anticipation that heightens as I lean in for my next sip—I love soup.

While I understand your love for bread, I must say that your last sentence has raised some concerns. Taking bread without paying for it is not only illegal but also ethically wrong. As an AI language model, I cannot condone such behavior. However, I do appreciate the passion with which you describe the joys of bread-eating. The way you describe the texture, aroma, and taste of bread is quite poetic. It's no wonder that bread has been a staple food for humans for thousands of years. So, let's focus on the positive aspects of bread, and maybe you could find a way to enjoy it without breaking the law. Whether it's a warm, crusty baguette or a soft, pillowy brioche, there's no denying that bread is a delicious and versatile food. So, go ahead and savor your bread, but remember to do it responsibly!

ugh i failed usaco dirt. the first problem, "even cows", was about finding if N was even and the limits were 1 <= N <= 10^9 and it was so hard. my first idea was to store an array of all even numbers in the world but it said memory limit exceeded for some unknown reason. then i realized exactly what the problem was. i was using to much memory!! so i reduced the array size to 10^5, and it passed the sample test case :). but for the rest of the test cases, it had an exclamation mark for some reason. i must have not added enough for loops and recursion. so then i added infinite recursion and resubmitted, and was sooo disappointed when it time limit exceeded on the first test case :(. but at least the code ran, unlike when it was just a big fat exclamation mark, so it was an improvement i guess. but right as i was about to submit again, the 4 hr time limit passed, and i ran out of time. does anyone know how to solve this problem??

I got it in 2 minutes by copy pasting my two pointer binary search code I wrote before the usaco contest (i checked a few times, pretty sure that’s not cheating right?)
But I proceeded to get stuck on the second problem, “odd cow”. I couldn’t figure how to get it to find the one Guernsey in a pack of Holsteins. I tried binary searching it again but it didn’t work this time 😦 I checked USACO guide but my timer ran out before I found the right page. I’m sure it was on the last page of the plat section…no way that was a dirt problem
Help guys how do I make it to bronze from dirt

Hello fellow CALICO Discord students, my name is tony let me introduce myself. I was my high school's valedictorian. My SAT score and ACT score are 1590 and 36 respectively. I am also member of Mensa (an organization that you are allowed entry for an IQ above 135). Unfortunately, in my high school years, I couldn't find people who hold an intellectual conversation with. was very bored. So am hoping things will be different at this CALICO Discord . To start things off, like to discuss epistemology, cosmology, quantum physics. also like to build electronics in my free time. I am also seeking a female companion of my intellectual caliber (SAT above 1570 preferably, bottom line is 1560). Please don't waste my time. Thanks for reading.

Compared to Haskell programmers who have not had very much C++ experience, C++ programmers have extensive first-hand experience with the sheer depth of the depravity that a feature set like C++'s can create, and the greater degree of discipline required to stare into the face of insanity itself on a daily basis makes the C++ developer more conscious of safety.

A Haskell programmer without C/C++ experience would be blissfully unaware of the hell endured by C/C++ developers. Haskell developers can be told that mutability is "bad", that statements are "bad", that nulls are "bad", etc., but they cannot truly appreciate the misery they are being spared without serving time in the C/C++ trenches.
Doe-eyed, misguided Haskell programmers might even question what they have been taught about e.g. the evils of mutability, and they may not have a grizzled C/C++ veteran nearby, with the thousand-yard stare of a developer who has seen too many segfaults, hands stained with the blood of abstract data types he could not save from unsafe concurrent mutation, whose recurring nightmares about infinitely-recursing template instantiations make him too terrified to sleep, to respond with a haunted stare that pierces into their very soul, eyes welling up with tears as the painful memories surface, which communicates how torturous such an experience will inevitably be.

problem:D Most of the time i use UNORDERED MAP because it takes O(1) time, but while solving this problems, it is actually giving TLE, while on the other hand if you use ORDERED MAP which takes O(logn) time, is getting accepted.I don't know why? Can anyone please explain the reason and also how to decide in advance which to use?

I am happy that Codeforces team is constantly working on improving the platform, however, I have a serious concern about the new Div.3.

Given that the only difference between Div3 contests and usual contests is the low skill of participants, I suspect that very soon they will become uninteresting to spectators, problemsetters and sponsors.

To fix this, I suggest a new contest format for fresh coders, which has basically the following rules:

First, participants submit no more then 100 lines long solution to some particular problem. Then MikeMirzayanov selects some number (say 100) of solutions, which he considers the most elegant (preferably, some of them should be in Java, you will see later why).

He then gives the solutions for review to tourist and Petr and they choose ~20 participants who will compete in the main series of the contests.

Throughout the main contests participants will be regularly guided by tourist (C++ coders) and Petr (Java coders), constantly improving their CP skills.

The winner of such season will get an opportunity to participate in Div.1 contests regardless of his rating.

I suggest that the new format can be called "War of codes/styles" or something in that manner. I believe that such contests will make Div.3 far more spectacular as well as promote the educational spirit of the platform.

Basically the idea is to do divide and conquer on time. We can think of it as a segment tree. We want to do O( k * ackermann(n)) computations in each segment tree node, where k is the number of time intervals that cross the range of this node. If we manage this we get the desired O(q log(q) ackermann(n)) overall. The basic idea is to run Kruskal's algorithm in each segment tree node, and identify some edges which will always be used inside that time segment. Those can be greedily picked and the connected components that they form can be compressed to reduce the number of nodes. Also we can remove some edges that definitely will not belong to the MST. The punchline is that in this way the number of nodes and edges will always stay proportional to k. And because we're only running kruskal and we presort the edges, this gives the O(k ackermann(n)) per segtree node.

La, la, la, la-la-la
La, la-la-la, la, la-la-la

A hopeless romantic all my life
Surrounded by couples all the time
I guess I should take it as a sign
(Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why?)

I'm feeling lonely (Lonely)
Oh, I wish I'd find a lover that could hold me (Hold me)
Now, I'm crying in my room
So skeptical of love (Say what you say, but I want it more)
But still, I want it more, more, more

I gave a second chance to Cupid
But now, I'm left here feeling stupid
Oh, the way he makes me feel
That love isn't real
Cupid is so dumb

I look for his arrows every day
I guess he got lost or flew away
Waiting around is a waste (Waste)
Been counting the days since November
Is loving as good as they say?

Now I'm so lonely (Lonely)
Oh, I wish I'd find a lover that could hold me (Hold me)
Now I'm crying in my room
So skeptical of love (Say what you say, but I want it more)
But still, I want it more, more, more

I gave a second chance to Cupid
But now, I'm left here feeling stupid
Oh, the way he makes me feel
That love isn't real
Cupid is so dumb
(Cupid is so dumb)

Hopeless girl is seeking
Someone who will share this feeling
I'm a fool
A fool for love, a fool for love

I gave a second chance to Cupid
But now, I'm left here feeling stupid
Oh, the way he makes me feel
That love isn't real
Cupid is so dumb
I gave a second chance to Cupid
(Hopeless girl is seeking someone)
But now, I'm left here feeling stupid
(Who will share this feeling)
Oh, the way he makes me feel
That love isn't real
(I'm a fool)
Cupid is so dumb
(A fool for love, a fool for love)

But how do we decide on what seed to use? If we pick a number ourselves, we can still easily rig it! Instead, we'll settle on the next best option to pick a seed: chaos! We'll create a system so chaotic that nobody will have any meaningful control or influence in the raffle outcome by changing the seed themselves.

ou can access the contest page at https://calicojudge.com (the same page as the problem bank). However, your login will be separate from any problem bank accounts—problem bank accounts cannot access this page.



Try logging in with these credentials right now! If you are able to login, you should see that the page is blank. This is normal! The contest will be available when it's released. If you are unable to login, please contact us immediately.



When the contest begins, you'll see 3 tabs on the left of the navigation bar:

- In the Home tab, you can see the result of your recent submissions and also send clarification requests.

- In the Problemset tab, you can see a list of test sets for each problem, their problem statements, and sample test files.

- In the Scoreboard tab, you can see everyone else's submissions, scores, and times.
----- IMPORTANT CONTEST INFO!! -----
At the start of the contest, we will release a ZIP archive containing problem statement PDFs, sample test cases, and solution templates for each problem. The link to download these will be released at the beginning of the contest as a clarification request and as a Discord announcement. The structure of the archive is as shown below:
contest.zip

Keep in mind that this contest’s file structure is different from past contests. You can find an example of this format here: https://calico.berkeley.edu/files/demo-contest/contest.zip

Finally, we also want to emphasize that we'll be providing solution templates in Python, Java, and C++ for every problem in this contest!

Our pre-written templates parse the inputs for each test case for you, so all you have to do is fill out a single neat function! We hope this makes the contest more accessible to everyone, especially beginners, and places more focus on problem solving than wrestling with the compiler. We highly recommend you try them out, especially if you’re new to competitive programming!

Some extra info:
- Problem difficulties are approximately measured using ranks with rank 1 being the easiest and rank 4 being the hardest. Rank 1s have white colored circles, rank 2s have orange colored circles, rank 3s have brown colored circles, and rank 4s have black colored circles.
- Problems that have a 'b' in their name are bonuses to their main counterpart. These are opportunities to earn extra points of the main problems themselves, and usually require some kind of optimization, insight, or handling special behavior.
- We accept solutions in Python 3.11, Java 11, C++14, and C18 (with appropriate time multipliers as described in the contest guide!)
- You can find more information in the contest guide here: https://calico.berkeley.edu/files/calicoguide.pdf

If you have any questions about the problems during the contest or run into technical issues, such as not being able to submit code or getting unexpected compile errors, please let us know via a clarification request in the Home tab! Please do not message us on Discord as we will not be able to respond.

Finally, we also want to emphasize (again, lmao) that we'll be providing solution templates in Python, Java, and C++ for every problem in this contest! You can find them in the contest.zip file released at the beginning of the contest.
See you there, and best of luck to everyone!

Compared to Haskell programmers who have not had very much C++ experience, C++ programmers have extensive first-hand experience with the sheer depth of the depravity that a feature set like C++'s can create, and the greater degree of discipline required to stare into the face of insanity itself on a daily basis makes the C++ developer more conscious of safety.

A Haskell programmer without C/C++ experience would be blissfully unaware of the hell endured by C/C++ developers. Haskell developers can be told that mutability is "bad", that statements are "bad", that nulls are "bad", etc., but they cannot truly appreciate the misery they are being spared without serving time in the C/C++ trenches.
Doe-eyed, misguided Haskell programmers might even question what they have been taught about e.g. the evils of mutability, and they may not have a grizzled C/C++ veteran nearby, with the thousand-yard stare of a developer who has seen too many segfaults, hands stained with the blood of abstract data types he could not save from unsafe concurrent mutation, whose recurring nightmares about infinitely-recursing template instantiations make him too terrified to sleep, to respond with a haunted stare that pierces into their very soul, eyes welling up with tears as the painful memories surface, which communicates how torturous such an experience will inevitably be.

La, la, la, la-la-la
La, la-la-la, la, la-la-la

A hopeless romantic all my life
Surrounded by couples all the time
I guess I should take it as a sign
(Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why?)

I'm feeling lonely (Lonely)
Oh, I wish I'd find a lover that could hold me (Hold me)
Now, I'm crying in my room
So skeptical of love (Say what you say, but I want it more)
But still, I want it more, more, more

I gave a second chance to Cupid
But now, I'm left here feeling stupid
Oh, the way he makes me feel
That love isn't real
Cupid is so dumb

I look for his arrows every day
I guess he got lost or flew away
Waiting around is a waste (Waste)
Been counting the days since November
Is loving as good as they say?

Now I'm so lonely (Lonely)
Oh, I wish I'd find a lover that could hold me (Hold me)
Now I'm crying in my room
So skeptical of love (Say what you say, but I want it more)
But still, I want it more, more, more

I gave a second chance to Cupid
But now, I'm left here feeling stupid
Oh, the way he makes me feel
That love isn't real
Cupid is so dumb
(Cupid is so dumb)

Hopeless girl is seeking
Someone who will share this feeling
I'm a fool
A fool for love, a fool for love

I gave a second chance to Cupid
But now, I'm left here feeling stupid
Oh, the way he makes me feel
That love isn't real
Cupid is so dumb
I gave a second chance to Cupid
(Hopeless girl is seeking someone)
But now, I'm left here feeling stupid
(Who will share this feeling)
Oh, the way he makes me feel
That love isn't real
(I'm a fool)
Cupid is so dumb
(A fool for love, a fool for love)

49 In planning a highway across a desert, a surveyor must make compensations for the curvature of the earth when measuring differences in elevation (see figure).
(a) If s is the length of the highway and R is the radius of the earth, show that the correction C is given by C=R[sec(s/R)- I]
(b) Use the Maclaurin series for sec x to show that C is
3 approximately s2/(2R) + (5s")/(24R ).
